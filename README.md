## Kuma
For my 2D array, I decided to make my favorite bear, Kuma, jumping out of a TV.
I put him together by making a patchwork of symbols and kaomojis I found on https://emojicombos.com. 

Head: (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶) 

Arms: ૮꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ა ♡

Ears: 𓏏

Cowlick?: ◞◟

Legs: ᵕ

TV: 모

Sparkles: ✶.˚✧˖°.

Unfortunately, the posts are anonymous and likely taken from elsewhere, so I wasn't able to credit or ask the creators for permission to use the art.

I reused the code from [ScrollArtV1.java](https://github.com/ifenghm/scroll-art/blob/main/ScrollArtV1Pattern/src/ScrollArtV1.java), and edited the variable names, changed the width and height, and slowed down the sleep duration.

## Bullet Train
Inspired by the [inchworm animation by Al Sweigart](https://scrollart.org/inchworm/), I made a bullet train myself using symbols which moves starting from the left of the screen to the right and resets. Knowing absolutely nothing about coding Python, I used elements from the other scroll art code, mainly changing the print method, making it restart at the beginning of the line, repeating the space, and speeding up the sleep duration.
